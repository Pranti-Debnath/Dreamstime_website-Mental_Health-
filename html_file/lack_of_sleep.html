        <h1>Can Lack of Sleep Cause Anxiety?</h1>
        <p class="namey">Sleep deprivation can make you feel anxious, and anxiety can affect your sleep. Here are some ways to reduce anxiety and help you sleep more soundly.</p>

        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Sleep plays an important role in your mental health. If you’ve ever been sleep-deprived, then you know how it can leave you feeling anxious and irritable the next day.

                The American Academy of Sleep MedicineTrusted Source says that adults need at least 7 hours of sleep per day to maintain optimal health. Anything less can lead to adverse health effects, such as anxiety and depression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">If your mind is keeping you awake or you’re unable to fall asleep and stay asleep, you may have an anxiety or sleep disorder. But there are things you can do to help reduce anxiety and sleep more soundly.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="sabiha">
            Are lack of sleep and anxiety connected?
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">“Lack of sleep and anxiety are highly connected. Those who suffer from sleep problems often have issues with anxiety,” says Dr. Julia Kogan, a health psychologist specializing in sleep and stress from Miami, Florida. “Those who have anxiety often struggle with sleep issues.”

            Kogan says that when you’re not sleeping well your body releases more cortisol, a hormone associated with stress. This can cause uncomfortable symptoms, such as headaches or digestive issues, that can make you feel anxious or give you low energy due to poor sleep.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">“The more activated the nervous system, the harder it is to fall asleep,” Kogan explains.

            So, if you’re feeling anxious, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to fall asleep and stay asleep. This can then cause a loop where you’re not sleeping and you’re feeling more anxious. This results in even more problems with sleep, Kogan says.</p>

        Can lack of sleep cause anxiety?
    </h3>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">If you’ve ever had a bad night’s sleep, you may have experienced a little anxiety the next day. Research shows that lack of sleep can contribute to this irritability.

            A 2013 studyTrusted Source found that sleep deprivation amplified reactions in the amygdala and anterior insula. These are parts of the brain that are associated with anxiety. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">These reactions were strongest in people who displayed high levels of trait anxiety, which refers to the anxiety that’s part of your personality.

            Having a lack of sleep doesn’t always mean that you’ll experience more anxiety. But the study suggests that people who are already prone to anxiety may experience a greater increase in anxiety when they’re sleep-deprived.
            
            A 2020 studyTrusted Source found that people who have insomnia symptoms are vulnerable to anxiety during times of stress.</p>

        Can lack of sleep cause panic attacks?
    </h3>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">When it occurs alongside other anxiety risk factors, a lack of sleep can contribute to panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear or anxiety that occurs unexpectedly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">“Someone who is not sleeping well is more prone to physical changes related to nervous system activation,” Kogan says.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">When there’s an increase in the nervous system activation, people breathe shallower and more rapidly, and this change in breathing can trigger a panic attack when the person is at risk for panic attacks.</p>
