            <p class="pranti">If you need to calm down immediately, you can do so by following a few simple exercises.

                Some of these strategies may feel difficult the first few times you try them, but with some practice, they can offer a quick path to mental peace and relief from your feelings of anxiety.</p>

            How to calm down quickly
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Something sets you off, and before long, you feel stuck in an endless loop of intrusive thoughts, pondering every possible thing that could go wrong. Your body tenses, your breathing quickens, and you can hear your heartbeat pounding in your ears.

            When you feel anxiety kick in like this, it’s time to calm yourself down. The first step is awareness. It’s a good idea to learn to recognize the first signs of anxiety and get to work right away before experiencing an episode.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="namey">
        Breathe
    </h3>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">One of the best things you can do when you start to feel that familiar panicky feeling is to breathe. It may sound basic, but basic is great when managing anxiety symptoms.

            Breathing deeply and slowly is key to experiencing the full benefits of it. It’s also a good idea to focus your thoughts on breathing and nothing else.
            
            “When we draw our attention to our breathing and really focus on it, the thoughts that trigger the anxiety start to become more distant, our heart rate slows, and we start to calm,” explains Dawn Straiton, doctor of nursing practice and faculty member of Walden University.
            
            Some people find 4-7-8 breathing particularly effective.

        Think about something funny
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">“Visualize your favorite humorous moments,” says Sultanoff. “One where you laughed so hard you fell down and [nearly] peed your pants. These can be real situations, or they can be situations you saw on sitcoms, in stories, jokes, or cartoons.”

            If it’s difficult for you to come up with something in the moment, try picking a couple of memories ahead of time, so you can go to them as soon as you start experiencing anxiety.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Like most mindfulness training, humor visualization takes you out of worrying about things that might happen in the future and focuses you back in your present circumstances, in the “now.”

            It does a few other things too. “You experience ‘mirth,’ which is the uplifting reaction to humor,” explains Sultanoff. You feel emotions such as joy, pleasure, or delight — all powerful emotions that can help you reduce anxiety quickly.
            
            And if you’re able to make yourself laugh by remembering that funny moment, he says, humor visualization is even more effective.
            
            “When you laugh, you contract and expand muscles, which reduces physical anxiety, stress, and tension,” he says.
            
            Laughter also combats the production of cortisol levels in the body, he adds.</p>

    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Distract yourself
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">If nothing seems to be working to pull your focus from your anxious thoughts, maybe it’s time to find a temporary distraction.

            For example, if you’re lying in bed, wide awake, obsessing about what tomorrow will bring and deep breathing and other techniques aren’t working, get up and leave your bedroom and find a distraction in another room.
            
            Focusing on something you really enjoy can break the cycle of anxious thoughts and give you some relief — at least until you’re in a better frame of mind to tackle those thoughts</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">What that distraction is, however, varies from person to person. The idea is to find something relaxing, pleasurable, or mindless to pull your focus from your thoughts.

            For example, some people find doing the dishes or cleaning their house to be a good distraction. It makes them feel active and requires some focus, but it pulls them away from just sitting there worrying.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Other people prefer listening to calming music, watching a favorite TV show or movie (just avoid one that is scary or stressful), reading, painting, or writing.

            Sometimes, simply petting your cat or drinking a cup of tea helps. Just make sure you pick a low-stress activity to pull your thoughts away from the source of your anxiety.</p>
