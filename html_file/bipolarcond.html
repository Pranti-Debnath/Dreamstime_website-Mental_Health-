        <h1>What Are the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder?</h1>
        <p class="namey">While some symptoms of bipolar disorder are more common than others, there’s no “one way” to be bipolar — every person’s experience of bipolar disorder is unique.</p>

            Types of bipolar disorder
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">To diagnose bipolar disorder, a healthcare provider or mental health professional uses the criteria in the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

            Bipolar disorder consists of two main types:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>Bipolar I disorder- This involves experiencing manic episodes for 1 week or longer. Some people also experience depressive episodes for at least 2 weeks. You don’t have to have depressive episodes to be diagnosed with bipolar I disorder — one episode of mania is enough for this diagnosis.</li>
            <li>Bipolar II disorder- This involves experiencing hypomanic episodes for 4 days and depressive episodes for 2 weeks. Hypomania is less intense than mania, while the depressive episodes in bipolar II tend to be incredibly debilitating.</li>
        </ul>

        Symptoms of bipolar disorder episodes
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Bipolar disorder symptoms typically start when you’re a teen or young adult. In some cases, bipolar disorder can occur in kids.

            During an episode of mania, bipolar symptoms can include:</p>

    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>inflated self-esteem or the belief that you’re more important, talented, or powerful than others</li>
            <li>endless energy</li>
            <li>talking very quickly</li>
            <li>racing thoughts</li>
            <li>seeming or feeling easily distracted</li>
            <li>feeling like you can accomplish anything</li>
            <li>intense irritability or acting aggressively</li>
            <li>not needing much sleep</li>
            <li>acting impulsively and finding yourself in riskier situations, such as unprotected sex, overspending, or reckless driving</li>
        </ul>

        Bipolar disorder in children
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Bipolar disorder can also affect children between ages 6 and 10. However, it comes with a different set of symptoms and is called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD).

            DMDD is a newer diagnosis that first appeared in the DSM-5.
            
            According to the NIMHTrusted Source, kids with DMDD have severe, frequent, and ongoing temper tantrums three times per week or more. These tantrums are out of proportion for the situation and inconsistent with the child’s developmental level.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Between tantrums, kids are also irritable and angry around their caregivers, teachers, and peers. And their irritability makes it really hard for them to function at school and at home.

            Treatment for DMDD includes behavioral therapy for children and training for caregivers. Sometimes, kids with DMDD also take medication, such as stimulants and antidepressants.</p>
