        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">There are many types of prescription medications and over-the-counter options that are used to treat ADHD in both children and adults.

            A physician, psychiatrist, or pediatrician will typically try different drugs and dosages to find the one that works best for you and your symptoms.
            
            The process can sometimes take a while.
            
            It’s natural to feel impatient or concerned about your treatment. You might even wonder if ADHD medication will change your personality or affect you in other ways. There’s no evidence to suggest this will be the case.</p>
