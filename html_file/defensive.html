        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Conflict happens frequently in personal relationships, at work, and even in public. Friction can be necessary, and even healthy at times.

                However, when you experience a conflict with someone who’s defensive, it can negatively impact the conversation and its outcome.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Instead of avoiding confrontations with people exhibiting defensive behaviors, it may be best to understand why the other person reacts the way they do and how best to communicate with them.</p>

        <h2 class="sabiha">
            What is defensive behavior?
        </h2>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Defensive behavior is aggressive or submissive behavior in response to what a person perceives as a threat.

                This type of reaction to a problem may be easy to spot. Your instinct tells you that your conversation has turned to where the person appears threatened for a reason, whether readily apparent or not.</p>

        How to communicate with a defensive person
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Since you can’t always avoid conflict, it may be beneficial to consider these tips and tricks for communicating effectively, especially with someone defensive.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Grow your self-awareness
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Before you can focus on others’ reactions to conflicts, it’s best to grow your self-awareness. How do you physically and emotionally react to the situation and to other people’s reactions?

            Understanding yourself can help you regulate your own emotions as well as clarify misunderstandings.
            
            In addition, it’s generally a good idea to remain open-minded to the ideas and perspectives of others.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Use ‘I’ statements
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">One of the most effective methods of communicating with a defensive person is using “I” statements. This means framing the effects of situation around your personal experience, not on what the other person did wrong or what it might mean about them as a person.

            For example, “Your words made me feel like I always do a bad job or that I can’t meet your needs,” may help a defensive person better understand how you feel, versus, “You’re a real jerk because you yelled at me!”</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Walk away
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Avoiding conflict isn’t always healthy. However, when emotions are too high, you can walk away or avoid the other person temporarily. Then, you can reapproach the subject once both sides are calm and ready to face it with a more open mind.

            An agreed-upon intermediary may also be helpful in resolving the issue. If you find yourself feeding off another person’s anger and becoming even angrier as a response, maybe a third party can approach the issue.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Compromise
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">When you compromise, you decide to negotiate with one another.

            Compromise is often the best course of action when settling a conflict is more important than getting what you want.
            
            However, this method may be limiting because you may be focused on ways to bend that could compromise some of your needs while trying to meet the needs of the other. This may not be as helpful a strategy they consistently push you to concede or compromise.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Avoid competing 
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Try to remain uncompetitive when approaching someone on the defense. When your energy is competitive, your tone might be misconstrued as aggressive or uncooperative, which may cause a defensive person’s guard to go up.

            Consider only responding in a competitive or forceful way when there is an emergency, such as when someone is in danger or when there are serious safety concerns.
