        <h1>What is toxic positivity?</h1>
        <p class="namey">Positive thinking can look like being grateful for the good in your life, looking on the bright side when you’re feeling down, and employing a can-do attitude when you encounter challenges.</p>
        <img class="depressionpage" src="Images/toxic pos.png" alt="">
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">The term “toxic positivity” refers to the idea that you should always think positively to the point where you shouldn’t express any negative feelings. In other words, it’s taking positive thinking to an extreme by negating the natural negative aspect of some life situations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Here are a few examples of how toxic positivity can look:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <ul class="pranti">
                <li>When you complain to a friend that your boss is overworking and underpaying you, they tell you not to think that and instead be grateful for your job.</li>
                <li>When you tell your family member that you’re feeling down in the dumps, they tell you to just “change your mindset” and “choose happiness” instead of listening to you.</li>
                <li>When you point out that a system at work is inefficient, your colleague tells you to stop being negative instead of exploring ways to optimize it.</li>
                <li>When you talk about a traumatic event you went through, others tell you to move on and stop dwelling on the past.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Toxic positivity can be harmful because:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <ul class="pranti">
                <li>Talking about your negative feelings and experiences isn’t “bad” but is often necessary to help you heal.</li>
                <li>Negating everything that may be perceived as negative can lead to dismissing valid feedback.</li>
                <li>We can only address harmful ideas/experiences/systems once we acknowledge them.</li>
                <li>Sometimes, we need help, support, and a sympathetic ear to feel better.</li>
                <li>It encourages you to hide your true feelings and pretend you’re fine when you’re not.</li>
                <li>Maintaining a positive mindset does not immunize you against harm.</li>
        </div>
        <h2 class="sabiha">
            Can toxic positivity be an OCD obsession?
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">While one person with OCD might have obsessions and compulsions around cleanliness, another might have obsessions and compulsions around fire.

            Pretty much anything can be the subject (or theme) of your OCD.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">OCD themes can relate to nearly anything, from your religion and relationships to your sexual orientation.

            And yes, toxic positivity can be a part of your OCD symptoms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">People with OCD are more likely to fall into the trap of magical thinking.

            Magical thinking is an irrational way of thinking — that is, one that isn’t based on evidence. Instead, magical thinking is based on the idea that your thoughts alone can change the outcome of an event — even when there’s no clear relation between the two.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            Everyone engages in magical thinking from time to time. You might pause to visualize yourself with lots of money right before pulling the lever on a slot machine. You might hold your thumbs and wear the same T-shirt when watching your favorite football team play a match.

But in OCD, magical thinking can go a step beyond and form the basis of an obsession. You might think:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>
                “I had a terrible intrusive thought that I hurt someone. This must mean that I actually will hurt someone.”
            </li>
            <li>“I dreamed that a hurricane happened, and a few weeks later, a hurricane killed hundreds of people. It must be my fault.”</li>
            <li>“I have a fear of being hit by a truck, but if I think about it too much, I might manifest it.”</li>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Identifying toxic positivity
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            Identifying toxic positivity is the first step in addressing it. But it’s hard to identify toxic positivity because it’s often filled with half-truths.

Yes, employing an optimistic state of mind can be helpful in many situations.

Yes, practicing gratitude does improve your mental health.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            Yes, sometimes dwelling on the past and overthinking a traumatic experience can make you feel worse.

            So, what makes toxic positivity a problem is not positivity but toxicity. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            Positive thinking becomes toxic when you’re expected not to feel your feelings or when you feel the need to pretend you’re happy when you’re not. It becomes toxic when you feel like you need to self-censor so that you don’t appear ungrateful or negative. It becomes toxic when you feel bad just for feeling bad.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        To heal, we need to feel
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            So, let yourself feel those difficult feelings. Give yourself the space and resources to work through them. And remember that positive vibes are welcome but not a requirement.
