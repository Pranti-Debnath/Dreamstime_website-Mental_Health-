        <h1>All About Depression</h1>
        <p class="namey">Depression is one of the most common mental health condition, affecting approximately 280 million people worldwide.</p>
        <img class="depressionpage" src="Images/depression page.png" alt="">
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">A sense of hopelessness, the feeling of being “weighed down,” and a loss of enjoyment in things that used to bring you joy — these are some common signs of depression, one of the most widespread mental health issues in the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Clinical depression goes by many names, such as “the blues,” biological or clinical depression, and major depressive disorder (MDD). The World Health Organization (WHO)Trusted Source estimates that approximately 280 million people live with depression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Even simple things — like getting dressed in the morning or eating at mealtime — can feel like large obstacles when you have depression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Depression symptoms take many forms, and no two people’s experiences are exactly alike. A person with depression may not always seem sad to others. And when friends or family do notice signs of depression, they may want to help but not know how.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="sabiha">
            What is depression?
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)Trusted Source estimates that about 7% of U.S. adults experience depression each year.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Clinical depression is different from sadness or grief — like when you lose a loved one, experience a relationship breakup, or get laid off from work — as it usually consumes you in your day-to-day living.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Unlike sadness, depression doesn’t stop after only a day or two. It can continue for weeks on end, interfering with your work or school, relationships with others, and ability to enjoy life.

            Some people feel as if a huge hole of emptiness has opened inside when experiencing the hopelessness associated with depression. Apathy and anhedonia, or inability to feel pleasure, are common aspects of depression.</p>

    <h3 class="namey">
        Depression symptoms and diagnosis.
    </h3>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">You’ll likely speak with a mental health professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or clinical social worker, who could diagnose your condition.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Though a general practitioner or family doctor can make an initial diagnosis, a specialist can provide complete follow-up and treatment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">If you’ve experienced most of the following symptoms every day over 2 or more weeks, you might meet the criteria for a depression diagnosis:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>a persistent feeling of loneliness or sadness.</li>
            <li>lack of energy.</li>
            <li>feelings of hopelessness.</li>
            <li>getting too much or too little sleep.</li>
            <li>eating too much or too litle.</li>
            <li>difficulties with concentration or attention.</li>
            <li>loss of interest in enjoyable activities or socializing.</li>
            <li>feelings of guilt and worthlessness.</li>
            <li>toughts of deaths and suicide.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Depression can look very different from person to person, and the intensity of the symptoms may also vary. Also, if you have depression, you might not experience every symptom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            Depression can appear differently in children than in adults. Some symptoms in children can include anxiety or anxious behavior.
