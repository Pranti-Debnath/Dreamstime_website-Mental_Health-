        <h1>10 FAQs About PTSD</h1>
        <p class="namey">Whether you or someone you know has PTSD, you might be filled with questions and concern. Here’s what to know.</p>

            First things first: What specifically is PTSD? 
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">PTSD is a mental health condition that can occur after someone has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event. Some examples include:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>natural disasters</li>
            <li>serious accidents</li>
            <li>terrorist acts</li>
            <li>a combat tour during wartime</li>
            <li>life threatening situations</li>
            <li>abrupt or impulsive behavior</li>
            <li>sexual violence</li>
            <li>a serious injury</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Symptoms fall into four categories:
    </h2>
   
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>Intrusion: Intrusive symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, or distressing memories of the events. These are unwanted and involuntary symptoms that can lead to physical effects like a rapid heartbeat or sweating.</li>
            <li>Avoidance: You may avoid places, people, and situations that might trigger panic or memories of the traumatic event. You might also stay away from anything related that reminds you of the trauma, like certain types of movies.</li>
            <li>Arousal and reactivity: Arousal symptoms are constant, rather than brought on by a trigger. This can include persistent stress or anger. Reactivity involves changes to how you react to certain situations. You might become easily started or feel edgy. Arousal and reactivity can both lead to sleep issues and harmful coping behaviors.</li>
            <li>Changes in thoughts and moods: The way you think and feel can change when you have PTSD. This could manifest as trust issues, new and negative self-perceptions, or feeling continually “on guard.”</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
         How is PTSD diagnosed?
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">PTSD is diagnosed using very specific criteria because it often overlaps or is misdiagnosed for similar conditions.

            In order to receive a PTSD diagnosis, a mental health professional will look for at least:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>1 recurring symptom</li>
            <li>1 avoidance symptom</li>
            <li>early life experiences</li>
            <li>2 arousal and reactivity symptoms</li>
            <li>2 cognition and mood symptoms</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Anyone can develop PTSD — it starts with one or an ongoing traumatic event where someone was in real danger, perceived a threat to their life, or witnessed danger or violence.

            Historical injustices, along with healthcare and economic inequities, may lead to higher rates of PTSD in some people. Preexisting mental health conditions and genetic components can also play a role.
            
            Whether you or a loved one has PTSD (or CPTSD), there’s hope. Many therapies and treatment options are available.</p>
