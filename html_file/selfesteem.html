        </div>
        <div class="selftext">
            <p class="pranti">When you’re dealing with low self-esteem, it can be hard to figure out ways to build yourself up. You might have a negative view of yourself or feel worthless, says Dr. Lori Ryland, a licensed clinical psychologist in Kalamazoo, Michigan.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="selftext">
        <p class="pranti">People with high self-esteem often feel confident, valuable, and worthy. But as important as it is to have healthy self-esteem, it’s not always easy.</p>

        <h2 class="sabiha">
            Prioritizing your self-esteem
        </h2>
    
        <div class="selftext">
        <p class="pranti">Self-esteem is how and what you think of yourself and having a feeling of self worth. <br>

        Dr. Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist and self-esteem expert in Sonoma County, California, says that when your self-esteem is low, it can affect many areas of your life.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="selftext">
        <p class="pranti">Low self-esteem might make you feel disconnected from yourself or cause feelings like: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="selftext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>aggression.</li>
            <li>passivity.</li>
            <li>jealousy.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="selftext">
        <p class="pranti">“It’s important to prioritize self-esteem because healthy self-esteem allows us to value who we are; healthy self-esteem is necessary in order to have a good relationship with oneself,” says Manly.</p>

        <h2 class="sabiha">
            5 ways to build your self-esteem 
        </h2>
        <div class="selftext">
            <p class="pranti">Building self-esteem takes time, so try not to be hard on yourself. Consider following these steps to help increase your self-worth. </p>

        </div>
        <h2 class="sabiha">1. Monitor self-talk</h2>
        <div class="selftext">
            <p class="pranti">If you’re prone to negative thoughts, it can be hard to change your thinking.

                Being aware of how you talk with yourself can be important for developing ways to deal with negative thoughts before they become beliefs that impact your self-esteem, says Dr. Margaret Delong, a licensed psychologist in New Jersey.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">Once you’ve become aware of unhelpful thought patterns, it can be easier to challenge them. Ryland suggests practicing daily affirmations or reading positive books.</p>
            </div>  
            <h2 class="sabiha">2. Notice how you’re comparing yourself to other </h2>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">You’ll always find someone who appears better than you in some aspect of your life, especially if you’re on social media. Try to remind yourself that you’re only seeing what they want you to see online. </p>
    
            </div>  
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti"> Delong says it’s important to pay attention to how you’re comparing yourself to others. She says comparison isn’t always a bad thing, you just have to be mindful of how you’re using it.

                    If someone has something you like or has achieved something that you want to achieve, that can fuel your passion and show you that it’s possible to achieve it, says Delong.</p>
    
            </div> 
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">“Our self-esteem is best served if instead of trying to avoid comparison completely, we are mindful of using it in ways that foster growth and positive self-esteem.” </p>
    
            </div> 
            <h2 class="sabiha">3. Surround yourself with positive people</h2>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">A 2018 study suggested that people with low self-esteem might surround themselves with people who are negative or tend to put them down. Additionally, the study indicated that others often respond to sulking or whining, which can reinforce low self-esteem. </p>
            </div> 
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">It’s important to evaluate the people around you and focus on the relationships that build you up. “If we surround ourselves with people who see our worth, we have a better chance to start to see it ourselves,” says Hennessy. </p>
            </div> 
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti"> Consider setting boundaries with people who may not be inclined to support you. Also, you may want to talk with a therapist who has specialized relational training and can help you build these skills, says Hennessy.</p>
            </div> 
            <h2 class="sabiha">4. Practice self-care and self-compassion</h2>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">Be kind to yourself. Learning how to increase your sense of self-worth takes a lot of practice and patience.

                    “When we have self-compassion, we are more resilient, and our self-esteem takes less of a ‘hit’ during difficult times,” explains Delong. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">She says that self-compassion is a prerequisite to self-care. And when you practice self-care on a regular basis, you’ll likely build higher self-esteem.

                    Eating nutritious foods and exercising regularly can be two great ways to practice self-care. But there are other ways that you can show yourself that you’re valued, too. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">“Write down one compliment every day and display it in a place where you can easily view it,” suggests Amber Weiss, a licensed mental health counselor in New York. When you receive compliments from others, it often makes you feel good. So, why not try it for yourself? </p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="sabiha">5. Develop a daily gratitude practice</h2>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">You can cultivate a healthy sense of self-esteem by being grateful for what you have.  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">“When we are struggling with negative thoughts related to the self that affect self-esteem, getting into a positive energy state by focusing on one thing that we are grateful for is one way to get into a lighter mood to help any practice be more effective,” says Delong. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">“Practicing gratitude is a wonderful way to elevate mood, boost energy, and counteract negative thoughts.” </p>
            </div>
            <div class="selftext">
                <p class="pranti">Weiss suggests starting a gratitude journal and writing down one thing you’re grateful for every day. When you focus on the things that you already have and that you’re grateful for, you’ll be happier with your life.</p>
