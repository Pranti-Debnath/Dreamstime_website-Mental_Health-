        <h1>What Are the Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder?</h1>
        <p class="namey">A more accurate way to understand autism symptoms is to see them as differences in communication and behavioral patterns.</p>
        <img class="depressionpage" src="Images/autism.png" alt="">
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">When you’re autistic, it can feel as if there’s a communication gap between you and allistic (nonautistic) people.

                You’ll likely experience differences in communication habits and behavioral patterns as an autistic person. Learning about these patterns can help you understand these gaps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">The differences that come with being autistic can bring both unique benefits and challenges. For example, some people find their ability to hyperfocus allows them to power through work, but small changes in the daily routine impact them much more than they do other people.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">According to 2016 data, about 1 in 54 childrenTrusted Source is diagnosed with autism each year. While understanding and acceptance of autistic people keep growing, some people may still not understand your needs and strengths.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">Autism exists on a spectrum, which is why it’s currently called autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The level of your support needs will usually help clinicians find where you are on the autism spectrum.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="sabiha">
            Language matters
        </h2>
        <div class="depressiontext">
            <p class="pranti">When it comes to talking about autism, we use identity-first language rather than person-first language. This is why we say “autistic person” rather than “person with autism.”

                For many autistic people, this language is preferable because autism is seen as as part of an identity, not a disability.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="sabiha">
            Autism spectrum disorder: What’s your level of support?
        </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">Since autism exists on a spectrum, the level of support needed in day-to-day life varies greatly from person to person.

            The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) looks at three levels of needs, which are defined by how much support the autistic person requires.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>Requires support.</li>
            <li>Requires substantial support.</li>
            <li>Requires very substantial support.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">In addition, many diagnoses tied to autism spectrum disorder are now outdated and seen as part of the autism spectrum. Some autistic people still identify with these diagnoses.

            Some of these diagnoses and labels include:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>Asperger’s disorder</li>
            <li>Rett syndrome</li>
            <li>Kanner’s autism</li>
            <li>high-functioning autism</li>
            <li>atypical autism.</li>
            <li>pervasive developmental disorder.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">
            Every autistic person is unique. An autistic person won’t always fit exactly into one of these levels or categories. For instance, some autistic people may be nonverbal but need only minimal support in day-to-day life.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Relationships and social connection.
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">People with autism may find it difficult to connect emotionally with other people, especially nonautistic people.

            Difficulties adjusting speech and behavior to match the mood of a conversation might make it harder for some autistic people to start or maintain a relationship, for example.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">In autistic children, this can look like not participating in games that involve imagination. Autistic children may also show a lack of interest in making friends, although this is not true for all autistic people.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="sabiha">
        Behavioral patterns
    </h2>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <p class="pranti">A large part of autism also involves behavioral differences. These differences usually involve limited and repetitive behaviors.

            These can include:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="depressiontext">
        <ul class="pranti">
            <li>stereotyped behaviors (repetitive behavioral patterns)</li>
            <li>rigid routines and dislike of change</li>
            <li>“narrowed,” or strong and specific focus</li>
            <li>differences in responses to surroundings</li>
        </ul>
